# Watch-Out!
A text-based C++ puzzle game where the player is located in a series of maps that are filled up with rooms. The player must step through every room to clear each distinct map. The challenge arises from the fact that each room can only be stepped on once and only once.  The goal is to clear each map.

The floor map for the Sootopolis Gym in the game Pokemon Ruby and Sapphire was what inspired me to make this game.
